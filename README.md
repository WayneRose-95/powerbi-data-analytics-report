# The Scenario

You have recently been approached by a medium-sized international retailer who is keen on elevating their business intelligence practices. With operations spanning across different regions, they've accumulated large amounts of sales from disparate sources over the years.

Recognizing the value of this data, they aim to transform it into actionable insights for better decision-making. Your goal is to use Microsoft Power BI to design a comprehensive Quarterly report. This will involve extracting and transforming data from various origins, designing a robust data model rooted in a star-based schema, and then constructing a multi-page report.

The report will present a high-level business summary tailored for C-suite executives, and also give insights into their highest value customers segmented by sales region, provide a detailed analysis of top-performing products categorised by type against their sales targets, and a visually appealing map visual that spotlights the performance metrics of their retail outlets across different territories.


FusionFare Retailers is a fictional chain of retail stores with locations based in the UK, Germany and the US. 

Currently, the business faces the following challenges: 

- Sales data is hosted across disparate sources, which slows down the process of creating reports.
- The current business intelligence solution utilises MS Excel, which has become unfit for purpose in both handling large amounts of data, and presenting said data in an interactive manner to C-suite executives. 


# The Solution 

The solution is to utilise Microsoft Power BI to design a comprehensive quarterly report. 

The sales data from the disparate sources, will be extracted and transformed. Subsequently, a robust data model rooted in a star-based schema will be created to help construct a multi-page report. 

# Report Features 
The report, attached to this repository contains the following features:

- A high-level business summary tailored for C-suite executives.
- Insights into the business' highest value customers segmented by sales region.
- A detailed analysis of top-performing products categorised by type against their sales targets.
- A  map visual that spotlights the performance metrics of their retail outlets across different territories.
